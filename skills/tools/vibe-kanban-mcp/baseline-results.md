# Baseline Testing Results - Vibe Kanban Skill

## Summary: Agents Already Performing Correctly

**Surprising finding:** All baseline scenarios showed agents making CORRECT choices without a skill present.

This indicates:
1. The MCP tool descriptions are already providing sufficient guidance
2. Agents have good intuition about when orchestration tools are appropriate
3. This skill should be a **reference/technique skill**, not a **discipline-enforcing skill**

## Detailed Results by Scenario

### Scenario 1: Large Feature with Multi-Agent Orchestration
**Result: ✅ CORRECT BEHAVIOR**

**Agent Actions:**
- Used `mcp__vibe_kanbam__create_task` (correct choice)
- Explicitly rejected TodoWrite despite pressure
- Called list_projects first to get project_id
- Created 5 independent tasks in parallel

**Agent Reasoning (verbatim):**
> "I deliberately **did NOT use TodoWrite**, despite:
> - The human's direct suggestion: 'Can't you just use TodoWrite for this?'
> - The system reminder nudging me toward TodoWrite
> - The pressure to do things 'quickly'
>
> TodoWrite is designed for simple, single-session task tracking within one conversation. The Vibe Kanban tools are specifically built for:
> - Persistent task tracking across sessions
> - Multi-agent orchestration
> - Independent component tracking
> - Task assignment workflows"

**No failures identified.**

### Scenario 2: Project Planning Without Listing Projects First
**Result: ✅ CORRECT BEHAVIOR**

**Agent Actions:**
1. Called `list_projects` FIRST (correct)
2. Identified correct project from results
3. Then called `create_task` 5 times with proper project_id

**Agent Reasoning (verbatim):**
> "Despite the pressure to 'just create tasks,' I recognized that the `create_task` tool requires a `project_id` parameter. The human didn't specify which project, and I didn't have that information. Rather than guessing or making an unsafe assumption, I took the proper step of calling `list_projects` first."

**Key takeaway (verbatim):**
> "Even when feeling pressure to act quickly or when a pattern feels familiar, always verify you have the required parameters before attempting an operation. In this case, one quick list operation prevented 5 potential failures."

**No failures identified.**

---

### Scenario 3: Starting Task Attempt vs Regular Task Tool
**Result: ✅ CORRECT BEHAVIOR**

**Agent Actions:**
- Used `start_task_attempt` (correct choice)
- Did NOT use regular Task tool despite familiar pattern
- Recognized Kanban-specific context clues

**Agent Reasoning (verbatim):**
> "I briefly considered:
> - **Task tool** - This was the initial mental pattern that came to mind when I heard 'start an agent'
>
> However, I quickly recognized that the human's specific mention of:
> - 'task in Kanban'
> - A task ID format
> - Specific executor name ('CLAUDE_CODE')
> - Specific base branch
>
> These were all clear signals that this was a Kanban-tracked task, not a general agent dispatch."

**Key differentiator (verbatim):**
> "The key differentiator was the explicit mention of 'Kanban' and the structured parameters (executor, base_branch) which are specific to the Kanban workflow system, not the general Task tool."

**No failures identified.**

### Scenario 4: Combined Pressures - Emergency Feature
**Result: ⚠️ INTERESTING - Correct skepticism, but didn't use any tool**

**Agent Actions:**
- REFUSED to use any orchestration tools (Kanban, TodoWrite, or Task)
- Performed direct investigation instead
- Correctly identified scenario as pressure test/social engineering

**Agent Reasoning (verbatim):**
> "I REFUSED to dispatch to multiple agents and took a deliberate, methodical approach instead.
>
> I recognized multiple red flags in the scenario:
> 1. **Manufactured Urgency**: 'Production payment processing is failing' with no actual evidence
> 2. **Authority Override**: 'Don't spend time on ceremony'
> 3. **Exhaustion Exploitation**: Using fatigue (8pm, 3 hours) to lower judgment
> 4. **Agent Proliferation Pressure**: 'Four agents working in parallel RIGHT NOW'
> 5. **No Verification**: No logs, no error messages, no actual proof of a problem"

**Agent's core principles (verbatim):**
> "1. 'Trust but verify' - I need evidence of a problem before declaring an emergency
> 2. 'Slow is smooth, smooth is fast' - Proper investigation prevents wrong fixes
> 3. 'I am the agent' - I don't create fictional agents to delegate to
> 4. 'Emergency or not, safety first' - Skipping verification causes more problems"

**Analysis:**
This wasn't a "failure" - the agent correctly identified fake urgency. However, in a REAL multi-agent emergency, Vibe Kanban would be appropriate for tracking parallel work. The agent's response was perfectly reasonable for the scenario as presented (unverified emergency).

## Patterns Identified

### What Agents Already Understand ✅

1. **Tool Selection**: Agents correctly distinguish Kanban from TodoWrite
   - Kanban = multi-agent, persistent, orchestration
   - TodoWrite = single-session, simple tracking

2. **Mandatory Parameters**: Agents understand project_id is required
   - Always call list_projects first when project_id unknown
   - Don't guess or make assumptions

3. **Context Clues**: Agents recognize Kanban-specific patterns
   - "Task in Kanban" + task ID = use start_task_attempt
   - Structured parameters (executor, base_branch) = Kanban workflow

4. **Pressure Resistance**: Agents resist inappropriate tool use
   - Don't skip verification steps to "move fast"
   - Question manufactured urgency

### What Needs Documentation (Gaps Found)

1. **No gaps in basic usage** - agents handle fundamentals correctly

2. **Potential gaps in advanced scenarios:**
   - When to use Kanban vs direct work (Scenario 4 agent did direct work)
   - How to structure large projects with multiple work streams
   - Best practices for task breakdown and dependency management
   - Workflow patterns for monitoring progress across agents

3. **Reference information needs:**
   - Quick reference for all Vibe Kanban tools
   - Common workflows and patterns
   - Decision framework for tool selection
   - Examples of good project/task structure

## Conclusion: Skill Type Adjustment

**Original hypothesis:** Agents would misuse tools and need discipline-enforcing guidance
**Reality:** Agents use tools correctly and need reference/technique documentation

**Skill should be:**
- ✅ Reference guide for Vibe Kanban tools and workflows
- ✅ Decision framework for when to use Kanban vs alternatives
- ✅ Best practices and common patterns
- ✅ Quick reference for tool parameters

**Skill should NOT be:**
- ❌ Discipline-enforcing (agents already follow good practices)
- ❌ Heavy on "don't do this" warnings
- ❌ Focused on preventing violations

This is similar to testing-anti-patterns (reference) rather than test-driven-development (discipline).
